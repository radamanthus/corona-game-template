Corona Game Template version 2.0
(c) 2011-2012 by Radamanthus Batnag

This is a template project for building games using Corona SDK (http://www.coronalabs.com)

USAGE
Out of the box, this is a working Corona project. It includes a splash screen (loadmenu.lua, displays images/splash_screen.png for 1 second) and the following menu buttons:
- Play
- Settings
- Help
- About

Note the naming convention for button images:
The buttons for Play are btn_play.png and btn_play_over.png; the buttons for Settings are btn_settings.png and btn_settings_over.png, etc.

If you have Ruby 1.9.3 installed, my Ruby gem [nakor](http://github.com/radamanthus/nakor) provides an easy command-line interface to generating apps from this template.
