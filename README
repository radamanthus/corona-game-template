Corona Game Template version 1.0
(c) 2011 by Radamanthus Batnag

This is a template project for building games using Ansca Mobile's Corona SDK (http://www.anscamobile.com/corona/)

USAGE
Out of the box, this is a working Corona project. It includes a splash screen (loadmenu.lua, displays images/splashScreen.png for 1 second) and the following menu buttons:
- Play
- Settings
- Help
- About

The images for the buttons are loaded from images/buttons. Note the naming convetion: play.png is the button for Play, settings.png for Settings, etc.

The project includes a Ruby script, generate.rb, for automatically generating your own menu code from the menu.json file.
This script requires Ruby 1.9.2 or MacRuby with the JSON gem installed.

To run generate.rb, just invoke it from a Terminal while in the project's root directory:
ruby generate.rb (for Ruby 1.9.2), or
macruby generate.rb (for MacRuby)

generate.rb will write the generated button code to menu.lua. It will be written between these two markup lines:
	-- Menu Buttons - Start
	-- Menu Buttons - End
Make sure there is nothing between those two lines before you run generate.rb

generate.rb will also generate screen code - one file for each entry in menu.json. For example, for the supplied menu.json file, four .lua files will be generated: about.lua, help.lua, play.lua and settings.lua.

Be careful when running generate.rb! It will overwrite any existing target files and you might lose some of your code.

You don't need to include generate.rb and menu.json when you deploy your Corona project.
