Corona Game Template version 1.0
(c) 2011 by Radamanthus Batnag

This is a template project for building games using Ansca Mobile's Corona SDK (http://www.anscamobile.com/corona/)

USAGE
Out of the box, this is a working Corona project. It includes a splash screen (loadmenu.lua, displays images/splashScreen.png for 1 second) and the following menu buttons:
- Play
- Settings
- Help
- About

The images for the buttons are loaded from images/buttons. Note the naming convetion: play.png is the button for Play, settings.png for Settings, etc.

The code follows my personal convention for project subdirectories:

appname
  +-- assets
  +-- appname
  +-- doc

- All code are in appname/appname. 
- Game assets (e.g. Illustrator .ai files) are in appname/assets, then finished PNGs are of course copied over to appname/appname because that's where Corona SDK expects them to be.
- The game design document (yes you should have one) and all other documentation are in appname/doc
